When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Either when I'm collaborating with other people, or simply when I want the
    added security of having my work saved elsewhere too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This gives you more control over what changes you pull; some changes may
    be undesirable.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork (github-specific) is like a copy of a git project, including its entire
    version history. A clone is similar, but is made from the command line, and is not
    github-specific. So you would use a fork when you're using github's UI, and use
    clone when you're working locally. Both forking and cloning copy an entire repository,
    while branches exist within the same repository; a branch should be used for making
    experimental changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It's easier to compare the local and remote branches with git diff and git log.

and what would be harder?
